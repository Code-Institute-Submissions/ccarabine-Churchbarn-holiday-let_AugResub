# Project Overview
## Church Barn
***

Church Barn is a lovingly converted barn, and holiday let in the sleepy village of Perranuthnoe, Southwest Cornwall. It is a place close to my heart, especially during the last year of lockdown, where we all learnt not to take our freedom to travel for granted.

To date, Church Barn has been listed on a holiday letting marketplace, who list the property amongst other competing properties in the area, they have full control/ownership of the brand, provide online booking, and charge high fees/commission.

## Vision:
Now the owner would like an additional platform to take back control of his business in marketing/selling the property direct to consumers, create more bookings, and manage the bookings himself.

## Objectives:
The goal is to build an intuitive and responsive website, achieving the following stakeholder requirements:

### Short term:
* CTA, invoke a positive reaction from the user to book directly with owner via website enquiry form. Increasing D2C sales will reduce agency fees/commission and increase margins/profitability.
* Showcase/brand Church Barn as an inclusive holiday destination to a wide audience of all demographics.

### Long term:
* Increase online presence and potentially eliminate the need for external 3rd party letting marketplace in the long term/future, managing all bookings, eliminating all agency fees/commission, increase profitability and take full control of Church Barn brand. 

## Responsive site
Using the website <a href="http://ami.responsivedesign.is/">Am I Responsive</a>, I used the image that you see below displaying my websites home page across mobile, tablet and desktop.

## User Experience

### User Stories:
* As a user, who occasionally abandons my purchases due to bad product information, I want a website that is easy to navigate, so I can access all the key information, such as property specification, for my holiday without any challenges or flaws.
* As a user, who can sometimes be impatient, and limited for time, my path to purchase needs to be flawless, I need to know how to enquire/book holiday instantly.
* As a user of any demographic, I need to feel well informed/assured of the property’s suitability quickly and efficiently.
* As a user I need assurance/security that I am booking a property of high standards/quality from a trustworthy/legitimate source.
* As a user who has never visited Church Barn or the surrounding area, I want a 360 overview of the attractions, beaches, places to eat and activities .
* As a user who has never visited Church Barn, I want relevant imagery to visualise/anticipate my holiday, creating the desire to book and look forward to my holiday.
* As a user of multiple devices, I need a website that is fully responsive, invoking the same user experience across all devices, in particular my mobile. 


# Visual Design

## 1. Colour Palette: 

A coastal palette has been chosen to correlate and appear aesthetically pleasing against the coastal/property imagery. The relevance of the coastal colour palette will appeal to all demographics and users and invoke positive first impressions/associations/emotions.

## 2. Typography

The following font Roboto have been selected to ensure the text is easy to read, add value to the text, and invoke user to perceive a positive emotion from the text. The fonts chosen are generic and therefore should appeal to any demographic/user. It is rated as Google best font.

## 3. Wireframe

I used <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a> to create rough wireframes for my project in order to plan out the layout of the webpage on both desktop and mobile devices.
