User experience to positive emotional response



I looked at the user centered design process that underpins user experience.  The five planes are:

Strategy plane - What are you aiming to acheive in the first place and for whom.
is the content cuturally appropriate - familys, couples, walkers
content relevant?

imporatnt that the users goals are met, that they can flow around the site intutively  interacti
Focus - 
Business objectives - to build a website for the property that will invoke a postive reaction from the user to book
Definition  - what are we creating - A holiday let website to get an online presence
Target audience: general consumers
interview people that would use the site - what makes a oot experience, when you go to a site where do you go first and why
Value - Amount of direct business increases, and becomes more profitability without any agency fees relating to direct bookings
tech considerations: mobile, tablets and desktops
Stakeholder interview - what do they want and what value it will give them!
minimal 3 steps rule applyed to book 
user objectives: single use learnings, is it fi
They're asking, either consciously or unconsciously, what is this? Is this what I expected to see?
Does it look credible and trustworthy?
Does it offer what I want?
Does it look valuable enough for me to stay?
Does it look valuable enough for me to return?
What actions can I take now?
How do I learn more?
How do I contact someone?
All of these must be addressed.

The Scope plan:

Functional specification - what features?  , based on informaiton from the strategy plane, do you want to include in your design?
e.g. So the features, for example, are the ability to request a collaboration and the ability to download our resume in a more traditional format.

The structure plan: how is the information structured and how is it going to be logically grouped
interaction design
consistency
ensure site is consistent, it's predictable, it's learnable, it's visible, and it provides clear and intuitive feedback.
Consistentcy
navigation elements appear in a horizontal fashion close to the top of your browser window.
All your elements and interactive features should be consistent, both in their coloring, their theming, and so on.

Content hinting occurs when you partially reveal elements of your page just above the fold.
The fold is the bottom of your browser window.
Because if you don't do that, the user won't know what's below, and they won't be encouraged to scroll.
So make sure content is visible wherever possible.
feedback - The form contains a button that has yet to be clicked. It hasn't been submitted yet, so the text is in white, and the background is in orange.
Once the user has submitted their information, the system should provide feedback to let them know that something is happening.
In this case, the system provides feedback in the form of a color change and a text change in the bottom.
So the text on the button went from "Sign Up Now" to processing.
Clear feedback to the user makes them feel assured.

hovering over links

Interaction design is learnable.
If you can answer yes to the following questions: "Where am I?, "How did I get here?", "What can I do here?", "Where can I go from here?", then you've provided a strong sense of place, you've set the correct expectations, and you've made it possible for people to accurately predict the outcome of their interactions.
